# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools with the aim of developing and mainatining a high software system.
Software engineering is important in the technology industry as it is used to create software applications and systems that are used to power different areas in the modern life
Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Development of programming language
Establishment of software engineering as a discipline
Advent of structured programing
List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirement
Design
Implementation
Testing
Deployment
Maintenance 
Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall follows a systematic sequential approach
Agile is Iterative and incremental 
Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
A software developer is tasked with writting the codeand coming up with solutions
Quality assuarnce engineer is tasked with ensuring software quality by executing test plans
Project Manager is tasked with planning, executing and delivering high quality software projects
Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Intergrated development environment is important as it provides tools for writting , debuging and testing code
Version Control Systems are tools that track chanages to the source code
Example of IDE is the Visual Studion while an example VCS is Git
What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
A software engineer maybe faced with changing scope of work, timelines
Some of the strategies include agreeing on the scope of work at the begining of the assignment, communication and adopting a software development method that will lead to best outcome of the project.
Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing is a test that targets the individual components of a software
Intergration testing test how the different components or modules of a software interact
System Testing test the entire software how it is working and
Acceptance testing is testing to measure the acceptability of the software project by the client
#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the act of of creating questions or statements with the aim of getting the best possible response from an AI.
Prompt engineering is important as it reduces the possibility of getting an incorrect response which is as a result of an incorrect query 
Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
How do I code. To improve this statement I would prompt as follows, Provide step by step process for coding an e marketing website for a cereal start up business.
